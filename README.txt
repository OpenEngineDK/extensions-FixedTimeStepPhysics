Description:
Basic physic system only working on rigid boxes. This extension 
demonstrates how simple but powerful physics can be implemented using
Verlet integration with fixed time step. This system is based on
solving length constraints so it's fairly easy to extend this in 
order to support all kinds of geometry models eg. spheres or complex
structures.
